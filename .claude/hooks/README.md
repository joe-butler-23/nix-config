# Claude Code Hooks System

Streamlined workflow enforcement through essential hooks with intelligent skill integration.

## System Overview

This hooks system provides focused workflow automation. The intent is to enforce minimal process guardrails that are difficult to ensure via documentation alone.

Design principle: keep hooks small; put procedures into skills.

## Log Locations

- Hook logs: `~/.claude/logs/hooks.log` (auto-rotated at 1000 lines)
