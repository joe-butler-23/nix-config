# Documentation Skill

Efficient technical documentation should communicate maximum value with minimum words.

## Core Principles

**Clarity First**: Every sentence must add value. Remove redundancy, filler words, and unnecessary explanations.

**Structure**: Good documentation is impeccably structured. Most important info appears the top of the document, Lead with actionable information. Duplication is avoided at all costs.

**Essential Only**: Include what users actually need. Skip background, philosophy, and tangential information unless directly relevant.

Good writing is clear and concise. Avoid verbosity: do not write 3 documents where 1 would suffice, do not write a pargraph where a sentence would suffice.

Efficiency is kindness to your users.
