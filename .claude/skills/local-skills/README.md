# Local Skills Storage

This directory stores skills that are **NOT automatically active**. Skills placed here won't be picked up by Claude's semantic activation system due to nesting.

## Purpose

- Store skills under development
- Keep archived or experimental skills
- Organize skills repositories without auto-activation
- Maintain skills that need manual activation only

## Usage

Skills here can be manually copied to the parent `skills/` directory when needed, or referenced explicitly in project configurations.
