# AI-Led Project Management

This repo uses an AI-first approach where the agent actively manages workflow rather than passively responding to requests.

## Pillars

### 1. Org Tasks

- Capture meaningful work in your Org workflow
- Keep concise progress notes in the task

### 2. Skills

- Use skills for procedures and domain knowledge
- Prefer progressive disclosure to keep context lean

### 3. Meta-Learning

- When patterns repeat, update or create a skill

## Quick Commands

```bash
nix fmt
git status
```
