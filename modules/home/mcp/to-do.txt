the purpose of this folder is to create a declarative mcp setup. it should be possible to add mcp servers to the servers folder, using wrappers where necessary, and adding targets (i.e. the apps that use mcp servers) to the servers directory. and then when i run home-manager of nixos-rebuild it should automatically generate the correct mcp json files for the targets to use. that way i have servers declared in a single place, but they can be used by different programems that all expect a slightly different format or location for their mcp servers. i want this set up for cline, opencode, and gemin-cli. 

currently i think i have cline and opencode set up with context7 but largley manually. im not sure the mcp.json generation is working. basically i need to re-review this whole section and run some test to ensure things are up and running. the resources i was using are https://lewisflude.com/blog/mcp-nix-blog-post but i think i may be quite far from this now.when i last logged off i had just got the creation of mcp.json in .config/opencode working. i think i now need to create an opencode.nix in the home/dotfiles folder that does something like this: 

'{
  programs.opencode = {
    enable = true;
    settings = {
      mcp = builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./mcp.json);
    };
  };
}
'

to pull the mcp stuff from the mcp.json file that gets generated
